1.Firstly we are bulilding the home page and for the backgrounds , icons and verious other functionality we will be using ui shadcn

In ui shadcn we have to install the functionality we want to use and then only we can use and all the installed materials will be stored in forlder components/ui, after running command for shadcn one folder lib will be created

In app folder we had created the provider.jsx file which includes all the headers and etc
whatever stuffs we want throughout our application we will use it in layout.js
In folder data we will be use colors.jsx,lookup.jsx and prompt.jsx 
In components folder and inside it we will have custom folder which contains headers and hero.jsx

We will be completing our header.jsx
Now we come to Hero.jsx  
making context folder inside messagesContext and inorder to use it we will wrap our content of provider.jsx inside it
Now we will be adding authentications - For that we will be adding new file inside context folder and create new file userDetailContext =>
to add authorizaton we will be taking shadcn for dialog box 
for these we had learned the new thing called dialog distruction in which we will pass a item like ' const SigninDialog = ({ openDialog }) => ' instead of 'const SigninDialog = ( openDialog ) => '
because on adding curly braces we have object destructuring to pull the openDialog value out of the props object.
Now we will add sign in with google functionality
So for that we will be using react oauth google we will install it
